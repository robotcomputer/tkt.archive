    Handjet is an element-based variable font (aka pixel font, modular font, â€¦) where every glyph is composed using multiple copies of the same element. Each element can take one of sixteen shapes and transition smoothly between them while creating various effects: a triangle appears out of thin air and expands into a square, the square rotates to create a lozenge and then scales into a thin rectangle, a rounded square smoothly turns into a circle, the circle into an oval, a clover becomes a rotating star, and a spindle, and a heart. The size of elements can be changed as well, producing different font weights. Plus, one can choose to use groups of 2x2 or 3x3 smaller elements instead of a single element. All of these work within a single variable font, allowing users to produce their custom variations and animations easily.

    The fonts supports Arabic, Armenian, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin. Arabic, Armenian, and Hebrew were developed with consultants Borna Izadpanah, Khajag Apelian, and Meir Sadan, respectively. Selected symbols representing wildlife and domestic animals are included together with various seasonal symbols and patterns.
